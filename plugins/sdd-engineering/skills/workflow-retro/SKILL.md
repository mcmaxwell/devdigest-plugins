description: Retrospective on a multi-agent run - what it cost, in what order the agents ran, and what the agent definitions should learn from it. Measures the session with the bundled `collect.py` (tokens, launch order, parallelism, per-agent tool counts, files two agents both read, where each agent's definition lives), then turns the numbers into durable lessons appended to the host project's `.claude/agents/INSIGHTS.md`, one dated line in `docs/retro/ledger.md`, and, where an agent's own prompt caused the waste, a proposed edit to that agent's definition. Use after any run that launched two or more subagents, after a `/run-plan` invocation, after a chain like specreator to implementation-planner to implementer, and when the user says workflow retro, agent retro, how did that run go, or how much did that cost. Do NOT use for lessons about the CODE - those belong to `engineering-insights` and its per-module INSIGHTS.md.

# Workflow Retro

`engineering-insights` captures what the session learned about the **codebase**.
This skill captures what it learned about the **agents** - which one was given too little, which one was given the same file three times, which one was the wrong choice for its step.

The two never share a file.
Code lessons go to the `INSIGHTS.md` next to the touched code; agent and orchestration lessons go to `.claude/agents/INSIGHTS.md` in the host project, and the dated run log goes to `docs/retro/ledger.md`.

## When it runs

After a run that launched two or more subagents, or any `/run-plan` invocation.
A single sub-agent call is exempt unless it went badly.

Do not run it in the middle of a chain: a retro on a half-finished chain measures the setup and misses the payoff.

## Step 1 - measure, do not estimate

```sh
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workflow-retro/scripts/collect.py"            # newest session, markdown
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workflow-retro/scripts/collect.py" --json     # same data, machine-readable
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workflow-retro/scripts/collect.py" --session <uuid>
```

It reads the harness transcripts under the user's Claude projects directory (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/`) and reports:

| Section | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| Header | Model, wall clock, how many agents, how many parallel batches, how many resumed via `SendMessage` |
| Tokens | Output / cache-read / cache-write / input, per scope, main loop and every agent separately |
| Launch order | Every agent in order with its task, resolved model, status, tokens, tool calls, duration |
| Agent definitions | For each agent type launched, the file that defines it: the host's `.claude/agents/<name>.md`, this plugin's `agents/<name>.md`, or "not found" |
| Main-loop tool calls | What the orchestrator did itself instead of delegating |
| Files pulled in by more than one agent | The duplicated-context bill, by path |

The script never writes.
When there are no transcripts for the current directory it prints `no data` and exits 0; a retro with no data is a one-line reply saying so, not an estimate.

NEVER hand-count tokens from your own memory of the session.
The transcript is authoritative and your recollection of it is not.
Three traps the script already handles, and that you must not "correct" by hand:

- **Background agents record no stats in the tool result.**
  Their numbers come from the agent's own transcript.
  An agent showing `async_launched` completed fine - that is the launch status, not the outcome.
- **Cache-read sums far above the context window.**
  It is context re-processed once per request, not a second copy of the work.
  Judge output tokens.
- **A resumed agent's duration spans the wait.**
  For an agent continued with `SendMessage`, the transcript's first-to-last span includes the time the user spent answering.
  Use the per-pass durations from the task notifications when you need real working time.

## Step 2 - read the run, not just the numbers

The numbers say what happened.
These questions say why, and they are what the next run actually needs.
Answer each from evidence in the transcript.

**Sequencing**

- Which agents ran in parallel, and which sequential pair had no real dependency and could have been one batch?
- Did any agent wait on a result it never used?
- Was the orchestrator doing work itself (a long `Bash`/`Read` streak in "Main-loop tool calls") that an agent should have owned, or the reverse - an agent spawned for something one `Grep` would have settled?

**Duplication**

- Which files did two or more agents both read?
  For each, decide: was that unavoidable parallelism, or should the earlier agent's report have carried the fact so the later one never opened the file?
- Did two agents reach the same conclusion independently?
  That is either a deliberate adversarial check or pure waste - say which.

**Friction**

- Where did an agent stop and ask, or return "could not establish"?
  Every one of those is a fact that its prompt or the project docs should have handed it.
- Where did an agent go down a wrong path first?
  Name the wrong path; it is the most reusable part of the retro.
- Did any agent return something the caller had to rework before it was usable?

**Coverage**

- What did the run miss that a later step or the user caught?
- Which agent should have caught it, and what in its definition let it through?

**Fit**

- Was each agent the right one for its step?
  Name the mismatch and the agent that fits better.
- Did any agent exceed its remit or write outside its allowed paths?

## Step 3 - write the lessons

Append to `.claude/agents/INSIGHTS.md` in the host project, same format and gates as `engineering-insights`: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] <one lesson>`, one per bullet, named agent, actionable cold.
Create the file with the headings below if it does not exist.
Sections:

- **Chain Shapes That Work** - an ordering, a fan-out, a handoff that paid off
- **Chain Shapes That Don't** - the sequential pair that should have been parallel, the agent that was the wrong tool, the round that changed nothing
- **Agent Notes** - per-agent behaviour: what it needs in its prompt, what it reliably gets right, where it stops
- **Context Handoffs** - what one agent must carry so the next does not re-read the repo
- **Cost Notes** - a measured number plus what it bought, so the next estimate is grounded

Then append one dated line to `docs/retro/ledger.md` (create it with a one-line heading if absent): agents launched, output tokens, wall clock, outcome, and the plan or spec the run served.
The ledger is the run log; the INSIGHTS file is the lessons.

Gates before writing, all must pass:

1. **Measured, not felt.**
   A lesson with no number, path, or quote behind it is an opinion.
   Drop it.
2. **Reusable.**
   It must change what the NEXT run does.
   "specreator asked good questions" changes nothing.
3. **Not already there.**
   Read the file first; extend a matching entry with a dated note rather than adding a near-duplicate.
4. **Not one-off.**
   A cost spike caused by the user changing their mind mid-run is not an agent lesson.

## Step 4 - fix the cause, not just the record

A retro that only writes a diary is a retro that changes nothing.
When a finding points at a specific agent definition, propose the concrete edit:

| Finding | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Agent asked for a fact the project documents | Add the pointer to that agent's definition |
| Two agents read the same files | Add the missing field to the earlier agent's required output |
| Agent overran its remit | Tighten the "Do NOT use for" line in its description |
| Wrong agent chosen for a step | Sharpen both descriptions so the router picks correctly |
| A round of the loop found nothing twice | Lower the round cap in the calling skill |

Where the definition lives decides how the edit lands, and the collector's "Agent definitions" section tells you:

- A host agent in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` - propose the diff to the user.
- A plugin agent (this plugin's `agents/<name>.md`, or another plugin's) - the file is replaced on every plugin update, so propose the change as an issue or pull request against the plugin, or, when the project needs it now, a project-local override at `.claude/agents/<name>.md` that carries the edited prompt.

Propose the edit to the user, with the evidence.
Do not rewrite an agent definition unprompted - those are shared with the team and a silent change to a routing description shifts every future run.

## Output to the user

Short.
The measured table, the three or four lessons that survived the gates, the agent-definition edits you propose, and nothing else.
The full metrics dump belongs in the tool output, not in the reply.
