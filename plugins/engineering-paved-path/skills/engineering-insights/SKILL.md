description: Captures non-obvious engineering lessons into per-module INSIGHTS.md files and reads them back at task start. Use at the start of every task, whenever a gotcha, a failed approach, a tool quirk, a recurring error or a tradeoff decision surfaces during coding, and as the wrap-up check before finishing. Also use when the user says wrap up, retro, lessons learned, add to insights, or TIL.

# Engineering Insights

A capture-learnings loop: each module keeps its own append-only `INSIGHTS.md` so the next session in that module starts with its lessons, not from zero.

## The loop

1. **Task start** - read the `INSIGHTS.md` of the module the task touches (plus the root one).
   Treat entries as high-confidence guidance unless told otherwise.
2. **Capture as you go** - the moment something non-obvious surfaces, append it (after the quality gates below).
   Don't trust "I'll remember at the end".
3. **Wrap-up** - before finishing a task, ask: did this session contain a problem, a solution, or a discovery that isn't captured yet?
   If yes, append it now.
   If the task was trivial (no problem/solution/discovery), skip.

## Where to write

`INSIGHTS.md` lives next to the code it is about: one per package (or per top-level module in a single-package project), plus one at the repository root for cross-cutting lessons.
Pick the file by the code the task touched:

| Touched code | File |
|---|---|
| one package (e.g. the web app, the backend, a domain library, the e2e suite) | that package's `INSIGHTS.md` |
| one module inside a package that keeps module-level insights | that module's `INSIGHTS.md`, else the package's |
| cross-cutting (e.g. shared contracts vendored into several packages, dev scripts, CI) | root `INSIGHTS.md` |

If the host project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` names the insights files explicitly, follow that.
If the file does not exist yet, create it with the section headings below and the first entry.

## What to capture → which section

- Approach or solution that worked → **What Works**
- Dead end / antipattern + why it failed → **What Doesn't Work** (skipped most often, worth the most - a "don't do this" saves hours)
- Convention or architecture decision + its reasoning → **Codebase Patterns**
- Dependency/tool quirk (version limits, weird flags, silent failures) → **Tool & Library Notes**
- Error seen more than once + the fix → **Recurring Errors & Fixes**
- Dated one-line summary of a significant session → **Session Notes**
- Unresolved question worth revisiting → **Open Questions**

## Entry format

`- [YYYY-MM-DD] <one insight>`

- One insight per bullet - dense paragraphs get skipped.
- Name the concrete file, symbol, command, or error message (`file:line` where possible).
- Abstract the lesson first: record the general rule, not the raw incident.
- Actionable "cold": an agent reading it fresh knows exactly what to do or avoid without re-investigating.
  Lead with why; NEVER/ALWAYS phrasing is fine.

Bad: "Promises can be tricky" - noise, not a lesson.
Bad: "Be careful with async."
Good: "Promise.all() on the ingest pipeline times out after 30 items - use Promise.allSettled() with batches of 10."
Good: "Checkout-flow state always goes through Zustand (cartStore.ts) - the cart is shared by 3 components; local state doesn't work here."

## Quality gates - all must pass before writing

1. **Anti-banality**: if it would be obvious to anyone reading the code - don't write it.
2. **5-minute test**: would this save 5+ minutes next session?
3. **Not derivable**: not in the code, README, or AGENTS.md; not generic best practice.
4. **Stable**: not about code actively churning in this very session.

If an entry can't be made that specific yet, hold it in Open Questions instead.

## No duplicates

Before appending, read the target file.
If the lesson is already covered, extend/update that entry with a dated note - do not add a near-duplicate.
Append-only: never delete or rewrite existing entries; correct a wrong entry with a new dated note under it.

## Limits

When a file grows past ~30 entries, flag it to the user for consolidation - don't prune automatically.
