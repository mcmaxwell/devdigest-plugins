# Testing per layer

The onion's payoff is testability: each ring has a natural test style, and the port boundaries are the mock points.
("With clearly defined ports you mock dependencies and test domain logic fast" - hexagonal literature.)
If the host project has its own testing guide (a `TESTING.md` or similar), it wins on file names and commands; the table below is the default.

## Which test where

| Layer | Test style | File suffix | Doubles |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain (`<core>`, helpers) | pure unit - call the function | `*.test.ts` | none needed |
| Service | hermetic unit | `*.test.ts` | mock ports via `ContainerOverrides` |
| Repository | integration against a real database | `*.it.test.ts` | testcontainers (a shared `test/helpers/pg.ts`) |
| Routes | `app.inject()` through the real plugin chain | `*.test.ts`, or `*.it.test.ts` if it hits the DB | mocked container |

Recommended hard rule: any file that starts a real database MUST be named `*.it.test.ts` - that suffix is what splits the Docker-free unit run (`vitest run --exclude '**/*.it.test.ts'`) from the testcontainers run.

## The mock point is the port, not the module

- To test a service, build a container with `ContainerOverrides` (`{ git: mockGit, llm: { openai: mockLLM } }` from `adapters/mocks.ts`) - never `vi.mock('../adapters/git/simple-git.js')`.
  Module-path mocking couples the test to file layout and silently breaks on refactor; override injection couples it to the port interface, which is the contract.
- If a service is hard to test without mocking a *concrete* class, that's a design smell: the dependency isn't behind a port.
  Fix the port (rule 4 in SKILL.md), then test.
- Domain package tests inject a scripted `LLMProvider` - deterministic prompts in, canned completions out.
  No keys, no network.

## What each layer's tests should assert

- **Domain/helpers**: input → output.
  No setup beyond arguments.
- **Service**: orchestration - given these port behaviors (including failures: missing secret, git error, LLM timeout), the right repository writes and enqueues happen, the right `AppError` is thrown.
  Degradation paths (e.g. unindexed repo → diff-only review) are service-level cases.
- **Repository**: real SQL semantics - tenancy scoping actually filters, `returning()` shapes, constraint behavior.
  These are exactly the things mocks would lie about, hence testcontainers.
- **Routes**: schema rejection (422 before handler), status mapping, error envelope shape.
  One or two per route - the logic already has service tests.

## e2e

If the project has an end-to-end runner, it validates the wiring of the whole onion against an isolated stack, ideally with deterministic doubles (no LLM, no keys).
It checks wiring, not business logic; don't move layer-testable assertions up here.
