# Fastify HTTP layer - routes as driving adapters

The route file is a *driving adapter*: it translates HTTP into a use-case call and the result back into HTTP.
Nothing else.

## The canonical shape

```ts
export default async function reposRoutes(appBase: FastifyInstance) {
  const app = appBase.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>();
  const service = new RepoService(app.container);

  app.post('/repos', { schema: { body: RepoInput } }, async (req, reply) => {
    const { workspaceId, userId } = await getContext(app.container, req);
    const { repo, created } = await service.add(workspaceId, userId, req.body.url);
    reply.status(created ? 201 : 200);
    return repo;
  });
}
```

Everything a route handler is allowed to do is visible here:

1. **Declare zod schemas** (`body`/`params`/`querystring`) from the shared contracts or a module-level `_shared/schemas.ts`.
   Invalid input 422s *before* the handler runs - never `Schema.parse(req.body)` by hand ("parse, don't validate" - the type provider IS the parser at the trust boundary).
2. **Resolve context** via `getContext(app.container, req)` - tenancy comes from the auth port, not from the request body.
3. **Call one service method** with plain typed arguments (not `req`).
4. **Map the result to HTTP**: status code, envelope.
   Domain errors surface as `AppError` subclasses and are translated by the shared error handler - handlers don't try/catch business errors.

## What routes must NOT do

- Import `drizzle-orm`, `src/db/*`, or any repository directly - enforced by the dependency-cruiser rules (legacy exceptions are allowlisted there, see `references/layers.md`).
- Branch on business conditions (dedupe, state machines, retries).
  If a handler has an `if` that isn't about HTTP (status code choice, header), the logic belongs in the service.
- Reach into ports (`container.git`, `container.github()`) - only services touch ports.
  The route's dependency is the service.
- Build DTOs field-by-field - mapping rows to DTOs is `helpers.ts` work, called from the service.

## Why this strictness pays

- The service is callable from any driver: HTTP today, the polling loop, a job runner, or a CI runner tomorrow - same use case, zero duplication (hexagonal symmetry: one port, many adapters).
- Handler tests become service tests (hermetic, mock ports) plus a thin route test via `app.inject()` - no HTTP server needed to test business rules.
- Fastify concerns (rate-limit, helmet, CORS, SSE) stay in plugins registered before modules; modules inherit them and stay clean.
