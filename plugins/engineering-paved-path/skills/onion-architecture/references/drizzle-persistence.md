# Drizzle persistence - repositories as driven adapters

Drizzle is infrastructure.
The repository is the adapter that hides it; the service programs against the repository's methods, never against the query builder.
("Repository mediates between domain and data mapping" - Fowler, via Stemmler/Sentry.)

## The canonical shape

```ts
export class RepoRepository {
  constructor(private db: Db) {}

  async getById(workspaceId: string, id: string): Promise<RepoRow | undefined> {
    const [row] = await this.db
      .select()
      .from(t.repos)
      .where(and(eq(t.repos.workspaceId, workspaceId), eq(t.repos.id, id)));
    return row;
  }
}
```

## Rules

1. **One table, one owner.**
   Exactly one repository class owns each table.
   Another module that needs the data uses the owning repository via the container (`container.reviewRepo`, `container.agentsRepo`) - never a second query against a foreign table.
   (Atomic repositories - Sentry; granularity per aggregate, not per convenience.)
2. **Every query is tenant-scoped.**
   `where(and(eq(workspaceId, ...), ...))` is the tenancy guard.
   An unscoped query needs a comment explaining why the caller's trust chain makes it safe.
3. **Repositories take `Db` (or `Tx`), not `Container`.**
   They are leaf adapters - giving them the container would let persistence reach ports and invert the onion.
4. **Return rows or narrow projections, not DTOs, with one named exception.**
   `$inferSelect` types (`RepoRow`) cross into the service; the service maps to wire DTOs via `helpers.ts` (`toRepoDto`).
   Wire format is not persistence's business.

   The exception is a *read model*: a joined or aggregated projection that has no row form of its own and exists only to be read.
   Typical precedent: a `listRunsForPull` that joins `agent_runs` with `agents.name` and returns the shared `RunSummary` contract, because no `$inferSelect` row describes that shape.

   **Decision test - does a `$inferSelect` row already describe this shape?**
   If yes, return the row and let the service map it; a repository that mixes rows and DTOs makes the service guess which it is holding.
   If no, and the shape only exists because of the join or the aggregate, the projection IS the return type, and naming it with the shared contract beats inventing a duplicate type that has to be kept in step by hand.
5. **Methods are named after intent**, not SQL: `findByFullName`, `updateClonePath` - a use-case vocabulary, so the service reads as business language (Muyiwa; repository-pattern-with-Drizzle write-ups).

## Transactions

The **service** owns the transaction boundary, because only it knows the business operation's scope; repositories accept the transaction handle and stay composable (Silva, pt. 2):

```ts
// service.ts - owns the boundary
await this.container.db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  await this.runs.markCompleted(tx, runId, verdict);
  await this.findings.insertMany(tx, runId, findings);
});

// repository - accepts Db OR Tx, never opens one
async insertMany(db: Db | Tx, runId: string, rows: NewFinding[]) { ... }
```

Open a transaction inside a repository only for an indivisible persistence primitive (SKILL.md rule 6's decision test), and never let a transaction span an LLM or network call - ports are slow and failable; keep tx scopes to DB writes only.

## Schema changes

`db/schema*.ts` is the only hand-edited source; the project's Drizzle Kit `generate` script produces migrations; never hand-edit `db/migrations/`.
