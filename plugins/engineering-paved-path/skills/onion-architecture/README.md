# onion-architecture - sources

Rules in `SKILL.md` and `references/` are distilled from these sources, adapted to a common TypeScript backend shape: a hand-rolled DI container, one folder per feature module (routes, service, repository), and shared Zod contracts that double as port interfaces.

  (reference only: the skill deliberately recommends a hand-rolled container - see `references/di-ports-adapters.md`)

## Evals

`evals/` holds the fixture-based review cases the skill was tuned on, the trigger queries, and `FIXTURE-NOTES.md` with what each iteration measured.
The fixtures are sample code trees laid out as `server/src/...` and `core/src/...`; they are examples, not a real project.
