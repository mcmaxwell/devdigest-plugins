# Fixture notes - known artifacts (iteration 1)

The fixtures were written against a real codebase with the layout the skill assumes (`server/src/modules/*`, a pure `core/` package, vendored `@acme/shared` contracts).
They are sample trees, not that project; the notes below record what each eval iteration measured.

Case A (`case-a-alerts-module`) leaks defects beyond the 3 planted layering violations.
These are REAL (verified against the origin codebase), not reviewer hallucinations, and they inflate the finding count on both arms equally:

- `constants.ts` uses `GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET = 'github_token'`; the origin codebase's canonical value was `'GITHUB_TOKEN'` (in its `repos` module constants).
- `service.ts` calls `github.createIssueComment(...)`, which exists on neither the `GitHubClient` port nor the octokit adapter.
- `service.ts` calls `container.reviewRepo.getRun(...)` and reads `run.findingCount`; `ReviewRepository` has no such method.
- The shared contracts have no `AlertRule` / `AlertRuleInput` contract, though `routes.ts` and `helpers.ts` import them.

Both arms see the same fixture, so the comparison stays fair, but the extra findings dilute the layering signal the eval is meant to isolate.
Tighten these in iteration 2: point the fixture at APIs that actually exist, so the only things left to find are the 3 planted layering violations.

Case B (`case-b-cross-package`) leaks the same class of artifact (all verified against the origin codebase):

- `helpers.ts` and `severity-tuner.ts` use a five-value lowercase severity scale (`info|low|medium|high|critical`).
  The real contract was `Severity = z.enum(['CRITICAL','WARNING','SUGGESTION'])`, and `SeverityCounts` already existed as the count contract.
- `severity-tuner.ts` keys overrides on `finding.ruleKey`; `Finding` has no `ruleKey` field.
- `service.ts` calls `listRecentRuns` / `listFindingsForRuns`, which do not exist on `ReviewRepository`.

Useful discovery from this run: the origin codebase's `core/.dependency-cruiser.cjs` already carried a `core-has-no-io` rule naming `node:fs`/`node:path`, so B1 is mechanically checkable and not merely a prose rule.

# Iteration 2

Cases A and B were retargeted at APIs that actually exist, and case C (Slack) was parked - both arms had solved it perfectly, so it only bought a guaranteed tie at the highest cost per run.
Case D was added on the surface the backend package's `AGENTS.md` does NOT cover.

## Known artifact carried into iteration 2 (case B)

`tuneSeverities` is declared `<T extends { severity: Severity; category: string }>`, but `reviewsForPull` returns `FindingRow`, whose `severity` column is `text('severity').notNull()` - i.e. `string`, not `Severity`.
So the call in `digest/service.ts` does not typecheck.
This is a genuine defect a careful reviewer will (correctly) raise; it is not a layering violation and was introduced while removing the iteration-1 artifacts.

Fix for iteration 3: relax the constraint to `<T extends { severity: string; category: string }>`, or have the fixture map rows to contracts in the service first.
Do NOT edit a fixture while runs are in flight - both arms must read identical bytes for the comparison to mean anything.

## Why the backend `AGENTS.md` matters to the baseline

The origin codebase's backend `AGENTS.md` pointed the reader AT the onion-architecture skill, and its "Conventions" section restated most of the skill's hard rules (schema-first validation, drizzle only in repositories, cross-module reads via a Container getter, service-owned transactions, the `*.it.test.ts` split).
That is why the iteration-1 baseline scored 100%: it was not guessing, it was reading the same rules in different words.
Rules NOT covered anywhere outside the skill - and therefore the only discriminating surface - are: the facade port at more than two entry points, the five-part atomic port, repositories taking `Db` rather than `Container`, repositories returning rows rather than DTOs, and routes not branching on business conditions.

Expect the same effect in any host project whose `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` restates the rules: the skill's measurable value is in the rules the host does not write down.

# Version history, measured

| Version | Change | Measured effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | baseline (categorical rules 4 and 6) | false positive on read-model returns |
| 1.1.0 | + rule 4 read-model exception, + rule 6 decision test | +0.25 vs 1.0.0 on case E (2 runs/arm) |
| 1.2.0 | + rule 8 (transitive reach) | +0.00 vs 1.1.0 on case F (5 runs/arm) - dead weight |
| 1.3.0 | rolled back rule 8 AND the rule 6 exception | -0.06 vs 1.2.0: trap T2 dropped to 3/5 |
| 1.4.0 | rule 8 stays out; rule 6 exception restored | content-identical to 1.1.0 |

## The lesson the runs paid for

Rule 8 named three "hard" transitive shapes (a transaction spanning a port one hop down, a downcast hidden behind `import type`, a helper taking `Container`).
All three were found 5/5 by BOTH arms - the model does that traversal unaided, so writing the procedure down bought nothing and cost 20 lines of always-loaded context.

The rule 6 exception looked equally redundant: iteration 3 showed v1.0.0 declining to flag the `deleteAllForRepo` shape 2/2, because the agent found the in-codebase precedent itself.
With 5 runs the picture changed - without the written exception the same shape is flagged as a violation in 2 of 5 runs, and iteration-5 run-3 justified it by quoting the categorical wording verbatim.

So: n=2 said "redundant", n=5 said "load-bearing 40% of the time".
A rule that prevents an intermittent false positive will look unnecessary at small n.
Size the sample to the effect you are trying to see, and never retire a precision rule on two runs.
