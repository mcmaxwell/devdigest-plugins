# frontend-ui-architecture

**Version 1.0.0** · 2026-07-31

Claude Code skill: React/Next.js frontend **architecture and code
organization** - where components, hooks, business logic, constants, utils,
and types live; how to layer logic; how to enforce import boundaries.

Deliberately scoped to avoid overlap with sibling skills:
`react-best-practices` (hook semantics, state anti-patterns, performance) and
`next-best-practices` (RSC runtime/data patterns, file conventions).

- [File Structure (FAQ)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) - React legacy docs. The official neutral baseline: feature vs type grouping, max 3–4 nesting levels, "don't overthink it."
- [Project structure and organization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure) - Next.js docs. The canonical page: colocation safety, `_folder`, `(group)`, `src/`, the three organization strategies.
- [Server and Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) - Next.js docs. Boundary semantics, client islands, children interleaving, providers-deep, `server-only`.
- [Fetching Data](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data) - Next.js docs. Where fetching belongs; `React.cache` sharing; client-side secondary path.
- [Authentication guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/authentication) - Next.js docs. The DAL + DTO pattern; why auth doesn't belong in layouts/middleware.
- [Server Actions and Mutations](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/server-actions) - Next.js docs. `actions.ts` organization, actions-as-public-endpoints security model.
